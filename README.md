# KTX Library for Unity

> The [KTX file format](http://github.khronos.org/KTX-Specification/), version 2 is a format for storing textures for GPU applications.

This projects provides a C wrapper for [KTX-Software](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software) including C wrappers for Basis Universal (.basis format) and a CMake configuration to build native libraries for following platforms:

- macOS (Intel only)
- Windows 64-bit
- Universal Windows Platform (x86,x64,arm and arm64)
- Linux x86_64
- iOS (arm64 and armv7a)
- Android (arm64-v8a and armeabi-v7a)

Those native libraries are used by [KtxUnity](https://github.com/atteneder/KtxUnity), which provides access to KTX files within [Unity](https://unity3d.com)
